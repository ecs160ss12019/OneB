| Epic Story        | As a player, I want a paddle that I can control and interact with the ball|As a developer/player, I want a menu system that is pleasing, but allows the user to have control over the game| As a player/developer, I want a ball that moves using some sort of physics engine in a predictable way| As a player, I want to be able to hit blocks and clear them with my ball in order to win| As a player, I want a dynamic video game whose levels change as the player progresses| I want to use a variety of Powerups to change how the game is played|
